# Wearable Data Affective State Classifier

In this proposal I have built a multi-class emotional affect classifier in Python using a 3-layer long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network trained on wearable data.  The classifier predicts three states of affect â€“ baseline, stress and amusement using the wearable data.  To accomplish this, I downloaded and used a publicly available dataset for WEarable Stress and Affect Detection (WESAD), available here:

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/WESAD+%28Wearable+Stress+and+Affect+Detection%29#

WESAD is a multimodal dataset that includes physiological and motion data along with self-reports of the subjects affect.  The following physiological sensor modalities were measured from the wrist and/or chest of each subject: blood volume pulse, electrocardiogram, electrodermal activity, electromyogram, respiration, body temperature, and three-axis acceleration. Self-reports of the subjects affect were obtained using several established questionnaires.

Here in this proposal I use a subset of these modalities -- accelerometer data, temperature data (skin temperature), and electrodermal activity to classify affective state.

## File Organization and Function 

  - Proof_Of_Concept.ipynb - ipython notebook with script to create the WESAD_data object that runs the data input, processing, visualization and model creation, fitting and testing.  
    - WESAD_data.py - python module with WESAD_data class definition, along with accompanying attributes and methods to perform data input and processing.  

## Environment and Instructions

You must first ensure the data is downloaded correctly.

There are two paths that need to be set correctly to run the notebook and python module:
  - path to the 'WESAD_dataset.py' python module.  This is set on lines 8 of 'Proof of Concept.ipynb.'
  - a path to the WESAD dataset. This is set one line 34 of 'WESAD_data.py'

## Features

The features of acceleration used were:

    mean for each axis; summed over all axes
    STD for each axis; summed over all axes
    Peak frequency for x
    Peak frequency for Y
    Peak frequency for z

The features of temperature used were:

    Min value
    max value
    Dynamic Range
    Mean
    STD

The features of electrodermal acitivty used were:

    Min value
    max value
    Dynamic Range
    Mean
    STD

## Results

Multi-class classification of this dataset has been done using other algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, Adaboost DT, linear discriminant analysis and k-nearest neighbors (https://www.eti.uni-siegen.de/ubicomp/papers/ubi_icmi2018.pdf).  The previous best reported multi-class classification performance using the ADABoost DT algorithm was 80% accuracy.  Using a three-layer LSTM neural network to do multi-class classification on this dataset, my solution improved the performance on the multi-class classification to 92% accuracy using only a subset of features used in the referenced paper.  This means my model improved accuracy by approximately 12% over the current benchmark iwth less features.
